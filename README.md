# TourismSiteASp.Net
---Not yet deployed

The project is a website/platform for tourists to explore places to visit in Egypt, accommodations to reserve, services to explore, and travel agencies to choose from.


- It's built with .NET MVC where we used Razor Views, HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery for the frontend, and implements the SOILD principles for the models, controllers, and services for the backend and authentication. And - of course, as we're mainly a GIS track - mapping for the aforementioned features where we thought to be of good use, using openlayers API and openstreetmaps geocoding service to provide searching functionality.
- We used a code-first approach and connected to postgresql as a database provider.
- Databae files - including database backup and insertions sample- is included in project folders.
